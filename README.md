My Python solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles 2017

The puzzles and some of the inputs (the ones I did not put into their own files) can be found on adventofcode.com/2017. 

Since all that was needed was a (often numerical) result, I did not pay special attention to the most efficient or modularized implementation but rather chose the one easiest to code.
